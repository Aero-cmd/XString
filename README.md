# XString

XString is a fast, tabbed web browser app built with Swift, designed to give power users a clean UI, rich keyboard shortcuts, and smart tools on Apple platforms.

## About

XString focuses on being a lightweight, native alternative to traditional browsers while still giving you advanced features like tab management, history, and private browsing.  
The goal is a browser that feels at home on Apple devices, with smooth performance and a minimal interface that stays out of the way while you work or browse.

## Features

- Multi‑tab interface with support for opening, closing, and reordering tabs.
- Clean toolbar with back, forward, reload, and home controls.
- Address/search bar for entering URLs or search queries.
- Basic browsing history and simple per‑session restoration.
- Optional private tabs that do not persist local history.
- Native Swift/Xcode project you can build, run, and modify.

## Installation (run the app)
# Cloning the repository (development)

git clone https://github.com/Aero-cmd/XString.git
cd XString
open XString.xcodeproj

# Normal installation:

Install from the app store "Link Here"

## Basic usage

- Type a website address or search term into the address bar and press **Return**.
- Use the back and forward buttons (or keyboard shortcuts) to navigate between pages.
- Open additional tabs from the toolbar to keep multiple pages active.
- Close tabs you no longer need to keep the interface tidy.

## Project status

XString is an early‑stage browser app and will continue to evolve with new features, UI refinements, and performance improvements.
